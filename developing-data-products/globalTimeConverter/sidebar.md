### Convert times from one time zone to another for a selected day and time

- All the input widgets on this `sidebar panel` have been initialized with a starting value

- Each session begins with the results for these initialized values displayed as the output on the `main panel`.

- User can select the **timezones, date and time** from the options presented in the sidebar on the left side and the time conversions will be automatically re-evaluated and updated.
